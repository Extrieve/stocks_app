# stocks_app

Developing a Flask website application centered around stocks, pulling sample data from IEX's cloud API.
The website serves as good practice for full-stack webdevelopment as it handles front-end HTML/CSS challenges with the help of templating languages(Jinja)
as well as backend data connectivity, using SQLite for ease and convenience.
> This project is still ongoing, my hope is add data analysis tools and apply them to the stock data.
> Users will be allowed to purchase, sell, or even trade stocks based on their budget.
