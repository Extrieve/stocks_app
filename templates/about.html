          Hello my name is <mark>Nicolas Cinera</mark> and I am the author of this site.<br>
          My friends usually call me Nick, and I am in my first semester in the BAIS Masters program at USF.<br><br>
          I am in my early 20's, so I don't have much professional experience <br> but I am eager to proof myself in Software Engineer / Data Science related roles.
          <br>In my free time I like learning about new frameworks, in the last few years I have been very passionate about Python.
          <br><br>Other of my non-code related hobbies include powerlifting, reading, anime, movies.
          <br>I am trying to go for a 405lbs squat before the semester ends (370 current).
